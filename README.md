-> Programming language developed at Google in 2007
-> Open-sourced in 2009

Why Go? Go use Cases
Evolution of Infrastructure:
	
Infrastructure changed a lot 
-> Scalable & Distribute
-> Dynamic
-> More Capacity

Existing Programming Languages did not fully take advantage of it
-> 1 task at a time vs doing multiple tasks at once

-> Multi-Threading Do multiple things at once.

-> Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once
	-> Developers need to write code to prevent conflicts

-> Go was designed to run on mutiple cores and built to support concurrency

-> Concurrency in Go is cheap and easy	


Main Use case of Go:
-> For Performant Applications
-> Running on scaled, distribute systems


Characterstics of Go:
-> Attempt to combine both:	
	-> Simple and readable syntax of a dynamically typed language like python
	-> Efficiency and Safety of a lower-level, statically typed language like C++

-> Server-Side or Backend Language
	-> Microservices
	-> Web Applications
	-> Database Services

-> Simple Systax: Easy to learn, read and write code

-> Fast build time, start up and run

-> Requires fewer resources

-> Compiled Language
	-> Compiles into single binary (Machine code)
	-> Consistent across different OS
